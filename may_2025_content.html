    <p>In May, the world quietly began arranging itself for something worse.</p>

    <h2>The Re-Emergence of Trump's Travel Ban</h2>
    <p>The return of the <span class="highlight-text">Trump travel ban</span> exemplified this, showcasing not merely a policy restoration but a posture of strength as cruelty, and security as selective exclusion. Though narrower than 2017’s infamous iteration, its message remained clear: some people belong, others do not. As <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/05/1253689639/a-new-travel-ban-is-coming-will-it-hold-up-in-court" target="_blank">NPR reported</a> on June 5, 2025, leading into the ban's June 9 effective date, this move "fulfills something Trump has long-promised: to bring back the travel ban from his first term."</p>

    <h2>Inertia and Centrist Leadership in Europe & Australia</h2>
    <p>Across the Atlantic, the German parliament handed <span class="highlight-text">Friedrich Merz the chancellorship</span>, a victory for inertia in a Europe bracing for economic contraction. Merz, a centrist technocrat, offers managerial austerity in lieu of actual vision. This was evident as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-economy-investment-merz-648aceb18b7c6c2bfa0a90f66a21a24c" target="_blank">The Associated Press noted</a> on June 4, 2025, that "Germany's new government on Wednesday launched a package of tax breaks and eventual tax cuts for companies, moving to encourage investment as it tries to give new momentum to an economy that has shrunk for the past two years." A similar narrative played out in Australia, where the <span class="highlight-text">Labor Party secured a second term</span>. Despite a decisive victory, as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-cabinet-labor-albanese-8cf65380812f7751b03afa16a6ff01d9" target="_blank">AP News reported</a> on May 12, 2025, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government continues to navigate a nuanced political landscape, mastering the art of governing without causing undue stir. As PV Tech highlighted on May 6, 2025, "Anthony Albanese is the first Australian prime minister to be re-elected since John Howard in 1998, 2001 and 2004."</p>

    <h2>Global Health Concerns and Domestic Distractions</h2>
    <p>But the surface calm pales against deeper fractures.</p>
    <p>In Malawi, health officials confirmed a <span class="highlight-text">sixth case of mpox</span>, with no clear source. The Public Health Institute of Malawi (PHIM) detailed ongoing efforts, stating on June 5, 2025, that "Investigations are currently underway to establish the possible source of infection and trace contacts," bringing the total confirmed cases to 25 since April 17, 2025. In the Philippines, the ruling alliance won its general election with thin credibility. In the United States, <span class="highlight-text">federal legislation against revenge porn</span> was rightly hailed as a moral necessity. On May 19, 2025, President Trump signed the "Take it Down Act" into law, a measure designed to combat "the increasingly prevalent problems of the online posting and sharing of so-called 'revenge porn' and 'deep fake'," as reported by <a href="https://www.pryorcashman.com/publications/the-take-it-down-act-becomes-law-combatting-revenge-porn-and-deepfakes-in-the-digital-age" target="_blank">Pryor Cashman LLP</a> on May 28, 2025. This vital legislation, however, landed with the pageantry of a PR stunt, overshadowed by the ongoing saga of <span class="highlight-text">TikTok bans</span> and a persistent national conversation around gun violence. Built In reported on May 20, 2025, that "unless a buyer is secured, TikTok is set to be banned in the United States starting June 19, 2025." Despite reports from <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/382-25/transcript-mayor-adams-removal-over-2-200-illegal-firearms-new-york-city-streets" target="_blank">NYC.gov</a> of a "4.9 percent decrease in major crimes" in May 2025, the Supreme Court's decision to toss Mexico's lawsuit against US gunmakers, as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-guns-mexico-737f69a7447647e13b49a2b1a7c72c57" target="_blank">AP News highlighted</a> on June 5, 2025, kept the issue of firearms liability firmly in the public discourse. </p>

    <h2>The Contradictory Nature of Modern Rights</h2>
    <p>The result is a curious dissonance: rights granted and revoked in the same breath. Citizenship is stripped in one country, restored in another. This tension is encapsulated by statements such as that from <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/federal-court-rules-in-favor-of-u-s-citizen-illegally-detained-for-deportation-by-florida-sheriff" target="_blank">ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt</a>, who, in a related context, affirmed, "The court properly recognized that the government cannot send people to a notorious foreign gulag without due process and then wash its hands of the situation." First-world parliaments performatively rebuke authoritarianism while their own borders harden, surveillance states expand, and labor markets grow more precarious.</p>

    <h2>The Alarming Silence of Global Institutions</h2>
    <p>Nothing captures May’s absurdity like the silence — the eerie quiet from global institutions and media as the machinery of repression whirs back to life, updated, more efficient. Trump’s policies return not with shock, but with scheduling. Protesters march, but cameras are mostly elsewhere. The <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-targets/canadian-lawmakers-urge-action-against-transnational-represssion-in-wake-of-china-targets-probe/" target="_blank">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)</a>, reporting on May 27, 2025, highlighted how Canadian lawmakers urged action against "transnational repression" where Chinese authorities reportedly target dissidents abroad, underscoring how "many democratic countries' intelligence and law enforcement agencies lack adequate expertise to deal with cases involving China's repression." Amnesty International, in a June 3, 2025 statement regarding a human rights defender in Niger, similarly decried that "Moussa Tchangari is being detained solely for the exercise of his human rights."</p>

    <h2>Anticipating June: A Future of Symbolic Gestures</h2>
    <p>By June, we anticipate more symbolic legislation, more abstract peace summits, and more praise for political “resilience” while communities unravel under economic exploitation, ecological pressure, and digital alienation. Concerns previously highlighted by the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/10/28/5-leading-concerns-about-the-future-of-digital-life/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a>, though from 2019, remain prescient: "Technology has the potential to further divide humans on a class level. Those who can afford the technology will have significant benefits... Those who cannot afford the technology will likely remain disconnected or will not receive the same level of service."</p>

    <h2>A Crisis of Permitted Authoritarianism</h2>
    <p>What emerges is not merely a crisis of leadership, but a crisis of permission. The liberal order is learning to live with authoritarian impulses, so long as they come dressed in procedure and performed regret. The fascists have the advantage, not because they’re stronger, but because they’re clearer. As <a href="https://san.com/cc/us-already-crossed-the-line-into-authoritarianism-experts-warn/" target="_blank">Straight Arrow News</a> reported on May 26, 2025, some experts are saying the United States already "crossed the line" into what they call competitive authoritarianism, with conservative legal figures like J. Michael Luttig warning about "the end of rule of law in America."</p>

    <h2>The People Bear the Burden of Clarity</h2>
    <p>As ever, the burden of clarity falls on the people — undocumented workers organizing in New York, nurses in Lilongwe tracing disease outbreaks, young voters in Manila demanding more than recycled strongmen. As echoed by <a href="https://cloakinginequity.com/2025/03/23/thoughts-for-students-gandhi-king-chavez-and-the-burden-of-moral-resistance/" target="_blank">Gandhi, King, and Chávez's philosophies</a> on moral resistance, the strength of a movement lies in its appeal to shared humanity and clear communication. César Chávez, for instance, asserted that "Nonviolence is not inaction. It is not discussion. It is not for the timid or weak It is the willingness to sacrifice. It is the patience to win." Without such clarity and commitment, "actions that are perceived as invasive or threatening can erode that moral clarity and hinder meaningful progress."</p>

    <h2>The Urgent Question: Building the Future Ground</h2>
    <p>The question for June is not whether the world is tipping. It already has. The real question is: who’s going to build the ground we land on?</p>
